# OMP-UPMSP Solver
> Solver for the Ore Mixing Problem (OMP) and the Unrelated Parallel Machine Schedule Problem (UPMSP).

## üìë About this Project
This is a research project in Optimization Models and Algorithms in Industry 4.0 and aims to propose heuristic solutions and modeling in linear programming for the [Ore Mixing 
Problem (OMP)](https://github.com/gabriaraujo/omp-upmsp#%EF%B8%8F-ore-mixing-or-blending-problem) and the 
[Unrelated Parallel Machine Schedule Problem (UPMSP)](https://github.com/gabriaraujo/omp-upmsp#-unrelated-parallel-machine-schedule-problem). The ore mixing and blending problem 
consists in determining the quantity of each ore, coming from a 
set of fronts or piles, which must be blended to form a final product with characteristics that meet the requirements of a specific customer. As the ores have different 
characteristics, whether the content of a certain chemical element or the percentage of an ore in a certain granulometric range, it is necessary to combine the ores in certain 
proportions so that the mixture meets the quality and quantity goals. Likewise, the machinery performs the stacking and recovery of materials from the ore stacks and due to the 
load differences between orders and the need to combine the ores to meet the quality standards, the time and the energy required to stack and recover vary considerably by job.

## ‚õ∞Ô∏è Ore Mixing or Blending Problem
The ore mixing or blending problem consists in determining the quantity of each ore, coming from a set of fronts or piles, which must be blended to form a final product with characteristics that meet the requirements of a given customer. As the ores have different characteristics, whether the content of a certain chemical element or the percentage of an ore in a certain granulometric range, it is necessary to combine the ores in certain proportions so that the mixture meets the quality and quantity targets.

## üöú Unrelated Parallel Machine Schedule Problem
The problem is to schedule a set of jobs, each available at a certain time, on unrelated machines. In this scenario, the machinery performs the stacking and recovery of 
materials from the ore stacks and due to the load differences between orders and the need to combine the ores to meet the quality standards, the time and the energy required 
to stack and recover change considerably by work.

Note that specific input files are required to execute the solver, available at <a href="https://github.com/gabriaraujo/omp/tree/master/tests" target="_blank"> `tests`</a> folder. To use the solver properly, run the commands from the root directory.

The solver outputs can be found in the created `out` folder. The generated results can be found in the `json` subfolder and the model details (lp format) in the `logs` subfolder.
