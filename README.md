<h2>Ore Mixing or Blending Problem</h2>
The ore mixing or blending problem consists in determining the quantity of each ore, coming from a set of fronts or piles, which must be blended to form a final product with characteristics that meet the requirements of a given customer. As the ores have different characteristics, whether the content of a certain chemical element or the percentage of an ore in a certain granulometric range, it is necessary to combine the ores in certain proportions so that the mixture meets the quality and quantity targets.
